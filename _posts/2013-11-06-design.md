## A quick post

I don't have any particularly interesting or insighful to add, but I would like to draw your attention to [Grantland.com](http://grantland.com), a popular site about sports and culture which utilizes marginal note (like this piece by Chuck Closterman about the [passing of Lou Reed](http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9892086/remembering-lou-reed). If you take away the more "commercial" aspects of this site (or not, depedning upon which purpose it serves) I think this general design is very pleasing, and would be particularly adaptable to academic writing. There are probably earlier examples of this layout, but the over all sight design I think is pretty notable.

Also: Some fonts that I think work particularly well for web design: Didot, Aster EF,  Baskerville, and my personal favorite font: Caslon Pro.
