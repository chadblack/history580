# *Fog of War* Response

I spend a lot of time thinking about how much I can comprehend— or, rather, how many things I can comprehend. I know what four apples looks like, and experiments tell us that we can instantly count something along the lines of 20 things with reasonable accuracy (I would site a source, yet I cannot for the life of me find it). When I hear news stories about billion dollar programs, all I know is that is an unreal amount of money— literally, I am, by virtue of being human, incapable of knowing what a billion is.

Part of this is hidden in our language, both spoken and especially written. Our number system allows us to conceive of large numbers by analogy with smaller numbers. "100, 000" is, well, one-hundred thousands, each number also able to be broken down even further. But this is only a useful tool of understanding and does not inform me much about what "100,000" of a particular item looks like. 

One thing which Robert MacNamera did in *Fog of War* was to equate deaths caused by the firebombing of Japan to American cities— it was an arithmetic of empathy, a tit-for-tat abstraction that uses useful terms of elision as points of equivalence— in this case, it was "Toyama" equals "Chattanooga," to use a local example. Of course, this is translation, not understanding. I don't know the city streets, people, or buildings of Chattanooga any better than Toyama, and truth be told I don't know what its like to have or see 99 per cent of a city destroyed.  

An analogy might help explain my next thought. In the bible, one census given for the Military-age men fit for fighting amongst the Israelites at 601,730, which would make the total population something along the lines of 2 and a half million or so. Not to be outdone, Herotodus has the Persian army ready to invade Greece at a staggering 2.5 million. While there are a number of reason why those numbers are inflated, one thing to remember is that even if the armies were a tenth as big as these numbers claimed, it is still an unimaginable mass of humanity which was trained to defend or attack you, depending upon your perspective. One unimaginable number is as good as a number; in this case, the larger one is better, since it highlights 


The fundamental belief of a "Technocracy" is that a logical, efficient approach (usually using a statistical model to define efficiency) to a problem is better economically __and__ morally than a purely intuitive approach. This is probably true if understood in the proper way. That's the rub, however. the "proper" way of understanding the moral superiority of Technocratic is to say something like, "if we are going to invade a country, here is who we ought to kill" or even "a military strike will be less shocking if a mindless drone is doing the killing, which saves our soldiers from harm." 

All of this is to say that we live in an increasingly abstracted world. One could argue that [the digital dollar should be the standard of our economy](http://blog.supplysideliberal.com/post/62693219358/how-and-why-to-eliminate-the-zero-lower-bound-a) in lieu of the paper dollar,  for a concrete example.^[Yeah, I said a concrete example of an abstraction.  You wanna fight about it?] Historians would do well to learn the processes and language of abstraction to speak to a culture which is already using it as the *lingua franca* of voracity. But we also should remember that the Humanities is about flesh and bone, sight and smell, memory and fallibility.
