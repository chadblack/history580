" A Follow Up on "Your Filename". I Know. Bear with Me"

I wanted to go into a little more detail regarding McLuhan's conclusions of content and form. I expect this is an issue that we will return to again throughout the semester.

1. What do we make of McLuhan's assertion that "the medium is the message"? (7-11)  
This suggests a bit of a paradox as the message(the medium) is destined to endlessly revert. In other words, if the content is the form then both rely on and shape the other; and neither has any true meaning.This not only suggests the problem we discussed in our week two posts of putting the media before the importance of the content itself, but also our second cause for concern-

2. The ubiquity of both form and content making both meaningless. McLuhan goes to great effort to differentiate between what he labels "hot" and "cold" media. In an environment were media is increasingly auditory and visual, a distinction based in sensory experience seems appropriate.(22-25, 35-37) However, if as both Himmelfarb and McLuhan anticipate, the dissemination of information becomes ubiquitous-created, destroyed, disseminated, and consumed almost parallel to consciousness itself- then distinctions between hot and cold media seem artificial. For instance, what difference is there between motion pictures or television programs or radio broadcasts if my access to each is youtube? 

Each of these questions brings us back to this ongoing tension between precedent of the form or the content. As digital historians we must try to understand the importance of either, but traditional academic scholarship implies the primacy of the content. My question is, in a new digital environment, how do we control takes the focus? At what point can we no longer distinguish between the two?## A New Post
