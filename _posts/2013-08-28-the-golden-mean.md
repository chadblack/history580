Had I been asked to give my opinion on DH before completing this weeks reading, I would have found myself among the likes of the conservatives and skeptics such as Himmelfarb and Noble as opposed to more forthright enthusiasts like David Parry.  In fact, my initial reaction to Parry’s quip about the role of DH being to “challenge and change scholarship” rather than “us[e] computers to ‘tag up Milton’” was one of bewilderment (Quoted in Fitzpatrick, “The Humanities Done Digitally”).  For one thing, all of the other readings emphasized how the development of markup language allowed for the computational analysis of text, which in turn produced dramatic scholastic developments (a high level of certainty as to the authorship of long disputed Federalist Papers being just one example). Secondly, working part-time in an archival setting for over a year now, I have developed a working understanding of structural markup languages like TEI and EAD and have experienced first hand the advantages these give to researchers, enabling more thorough research and presumably a more comprehensive assessment of any given subject.  

Not wanting to take cheap shots at Parry based on a standalone quote, suffice it to say that I find his statement to be in error.  The role of DH need not be formulated as an either/or between taking advantage of basic text markup to supplement longstanding historiographical convention on the one hand and exclusive devotion to the nonlinearity/hypertextuality and manipulability of data afforded by the ever-increasing processing power of computer technology on the other.  I see no reason why a practitioner of DH cannot adopt a both/and approach--retaining the traditional historical methodology and linear narratives which are the mainstays of peer-reviewed journal articles, monographs, theses, dissertations, etc., while at the same time taking advantage of the unique opportunities for collaboration, participation, and exploration made possible by digital technologies.

In short, these readings helped to shape my aspirations and expectations for the semester.  Namely, to occupy a position somewhere between a bystander and the vanguard of DH. I hope to become more skilled at using digital technology to conduct historical research and the subsequent presentation/interpretation thereof, while at the same time developing a critical eye for ways in which the DH can be changed or improved.
