title: "Week 5 Lab: The Hard Side of Digital Humanities"
author: jtomlin1

The lab for this week focuses on the issue of durability in the sense that Cohen and Rosenzweig referenced, but also in respect to the need to access and harvest the "hard" side of digital humanities.( That is a subtle pun, so reserve an appropriate amount of time for laughter). The first element of the lab for this week concerns the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. In addition to several initiatives drawing private and public support for continuing "web-based" computing research and presentation, the Museum offers numerous permanent displays of artifacts from a history of computing the museum traces as far back as 2000 years. See the link here
http://www.computerhistory.org/about/.  The Museum started in 1979 as the Digital Computer Museum organized as a subunit within the Digital Equipment Corporation in Marlborough, Massachusetts. It's primary goal was to preserve some of the components of the fast-changing computer world as part of a larger historical process. In 1984, the museum dropped the "digital" part of its title and relocated to downtown Boston; slowly growing and acquiring numerous permanent exhibits including early semi-conducting card press technology going back as far as the 1920s. By 1996, the museum's collections were so numerous that the Computer Museum was forced to split; moving the majority of it's warehoused collections and artifacts to a larger storage complex in Mountain View under the new title "Computer History Museum". The Boston center closed in 1999, completing the legal side of a larger shift that focused on an enlarged view of computing's history beyond that of 20th century computing technology itself. 

From 2000-2010, the Museum has continued to enlarge its collections. Only 10% of its collections can be displayed at any given time in the massive main Museum building in the heart of silicon valley. During that time, the Museum has also picked up a veritable who's-who of industry elites, executives, and innovators dedicated to the work of preserving the evolution of computing technology. Check these links to see some of the big names associated with the Museum's work.

In addition to it's "hard copy" exhibits( I know, now I'm just being gratuitous), the Museum began offering an internet version of it's famed "Revolution exhibit. It features an interactive timeline of computing from the abacus to the web. I'm not sure that McLuhan's timeline fits this, but I'm sure someone will eagerly argue that we are talking about separate things. In any case, here is a link to the Revolution internet exhibit and the interactive timeline. http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/topics#exhibition and http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/timeline.

Next we will move to the Internet Archive portion of the lab. This portion of the lab deals with Cohen and Rosenzweig's reservations about durability directly; that is, the need to preserve digital materials and access their content in an ever-changing world of formats and hardware. The Internet Archive seeks to do this across an array of computing devices and web-based texts and publications. Here is more about the Archive itself http://archive.org/about/.  The Computer Newsletters site does exactly what the name suggests: providing a database of group newsletters and publications that range in specialty from specific machine enthusiasts(there is a Ti-83 owner's letter) to sub-genres of hackers( one from 1974 is for telephone hackers). In short, this sort of database is designed to preserve the information traded/shared for over four decades about various elements of computing that may not have been preserved in hard copy form; thus lacking durability after previous host sites and forums have closed. Check out some of the texts here  http://archive.org/details/computernewsletters.

Of course, having the information is only the beginning of a bigger problem without an efficient means of accessing vast amounts of data in order to make better sense of the content therein. That is where Folkscanomy comes in. This site offers to provide greater access to texts on various elements of computing hardware such as electronics, circuits, and processors. Moreover, the site offers indexing and tags to aid in the search of the content, which otherwise would be so great in volume as to make web access difficult and unwieldy. Look here for more on what Folkscanomy offers     http://archive.org/details/folkscanomy_electronics

Other resources continue to work on easing the access of digital content in other ways. Bitcurator is one such resource. Get a better feel for it herehttp://www.bitcurator.net.  This open-source software project seeks to develop various softwares and computing strategies to aid in "digital forensics". What the Bitcurator seeks to do is introduce the tools needed by archivists, researchers, and Librarians to organize and store digital content. It also seeks to provide the tools, at a reasonable price point for small institutions and individuals, needed to continue to access digital content preserved on outmoded hardware and that "digital-born" content left seemingly unavailable by continuous format changes. Considering a new generation of researchers and content organizers will be dealing more and more with digital content never extent in hard copy format, and that even more work will be needed to analyze the vast quantity of information curators must manage in a digital world, this resource will be an important tool for aspiring historians to familiarize themselves with. This resource also draws from a large group of dedicated professionals who are working on new ways to access and analyze digital content. See them here, and note the many english majors
