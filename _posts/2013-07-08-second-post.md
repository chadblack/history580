## Written in Prose.io

This posts is written in [prose.io](http://prose.io). I added my own github account, [parezcoydigo](https://github.com/parezcoydigo), as a collaborator on the history580 repo, and link prose.io to parezcoydigo. Each student will need to setup a github account, and I will add them as collaborators. This will, of course, give them the ability to edit the whole site. It will also leave a commit trail.
