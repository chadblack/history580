One thing that struck me as interesting in this week’s book was the contention of the authors in the introduction that “Historians want it both ways: we desire instant access to the newest works in our field, while also demanding that the past be safely archived. We also insist on having the choice to read on screen or in print.”  While Kristen Nawrotzki and Jack Dougherty argue that digital media will not detract from print media, I find that hard to believe.  From what we have seen thus far in the class, digital media seems to in fact do just that.  That’s part of its appeal, especially to publishers.  

Personally, I find that I cannot react to a book the same if is digital and understand why they would add that it does not takeaway or decrease print publishing.  Not in the reading process, but the research and analytical part I get lost in the digital.  Quite simply, I find it hard to skim an online book after I have read it to get the most important elements when I need them.  I wonder if others have the same difficulty. That being said, I know from conversations from my students that they don’t have a similar issue.  Therefore, is the problem I have something that can be learned?  Is it generational?  Regardless, I do not think that the authors are correct in their point and believe that print is going the way of the a-track.
