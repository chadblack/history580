## Markdown

I thought the members of this class might find this intersting:[Here](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/my-academic-book-in-plain-text.html) is an argument for using markdown (the markup language we use when posting for this site). After spending about an hour practicing with it, I am amazed how much easier and *faster* I write with markdown in a text editor (I use the [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) implementation). I find I can concentrate more and that I write in about half the time-- and that's not an exaggeration. I was suprised how easy it was to pick up-- once you learn how to bold and italicize, how to create a footnote, and how to make a list, it is a very natural process. I was also impressed how easily it would generate PDF's (using LaTex) and .docx files. Just thought I would pass this along to anyone who has a free hour and wants to learn a bit more.
