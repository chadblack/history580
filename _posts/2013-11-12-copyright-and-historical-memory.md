One of the most interesting aspects of _Free Culture_was how the extensions of copyright law, CTEA, applied to estates in order to regulate the use of "American icons" or iconographic media.  I find this very problematic to my job as a cultural historian as it not only limits the material I can include within my work, but also what that material looks like.  Because this law favors certain types of material, that changes the very nature of its historical context.  It creates an arbitrary category based on the subjective judgments of the current political body to determine what is and what is not “high” culture and therefore worthy of extended copyright.  This in turn develops historical memory, an essential component to many cultural studies.  

Although this is not troubling in itself as context often explains historical memory, for example the changing historical memory of the Civil War, when extended to its extreme, this law and the history it develops creates problems for a historian. In this instance it is the very nature of the law that can inhibit its analysis.  If a copyright is extended to a point that a historian needs permission to include it within their work, the very false historical memory that law creates becomes difficult to refute.  For example, if one wanted to write about _Porgy and Bess_in a way the Gershwin estate found problematic to his image, they could easily block use of the play if it exceeded fair use policies.  Though this is unlikely due to the protection of academic works, it is in theory at least possible.  This in turn helps perpetuate a false and misleading memory of both the author and the work.
