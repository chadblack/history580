## "It's Only a Model"

![Camelot](<iframe width="854" height="510" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/m3dZl3yfGpc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>)

Beginning with last week's readings (and certainly encouraged by this weeks readings) I began to wondering just what a post-print (or at least a post-publisher) world might look like. Some of my considerations, in no particular order:

1) In the world of academic publishing, the relationship between author and publisher is a fairly simple one. The author provides, with no direct cost to the publisher, a voice already trained by a seperate system (Academia) of verification combined with something ostensibly origininal (a dissertation or an article or a chapter) which the academic system already provides the impetus for creating. In return, the author gets what might best be termed as "gravitas": tangible evidence of their work, run through a seperate system of verification (peer review) which is also something done with little cost to the publisher) and "publicised" and verifed through book reviews. 

2) Computers make it possible to eschew this system where the work of writing feeds into this system of publishing and only vague but signifigant benfits are extracted (tenure, mainly). 

3) However, there is more to publishing a book than simply the writing of it. Copy editors are important, as are graphic designers. Complicated legal issues can occasionally crop up in the world of publishing, which means that lawyers are always nice to have around. Rights to various images and other media can be difficult to negotiate, too.  Also, and this is important: peer review is an important process dependant upon more than just the degree and status of the reviewer; peer review-- or, rather, its advantages-- can be undone by poor design, poor editing, and even simply being a purely digital project.

While *Planned Obsolescense* is a noble project (and open peer review is a noble idea), I don't think this is a sustainable model. For starters, there is a problem with just how "open" peer review can be. If entierly open (names associated with specific comments) its hard to see just how "open" this system is; if anonymous-but-still-present commenting is the norm, it is difficult to see how this won't reaveal just enough petty comments to make the system crumble into the background.

Like it or not, the scholarly credentials of a particualr reviewer are not sufficent to render a work "scholarly" or "not schoalrly". Scholarly credibility is not easily accepted on the basis of two or three reviewers; it is much more simple to trust a book publisher under a single name. "Harvard University Press" is a very clean example of this-- this name carries weight across disciplines effectively and, in  a very signifigant sense, more directly. People don't want to wade through a messy system of peer review to decide on the merits of a project; they want the finnished product.  

It seems to me to be a poor read of the situation to imagine that an open publishing format is the only possible solution to the uncertain future of publishing. What the current state of publishing suggests isn't that a whole new system of verifaction must be implemented; it is that publishing is something which is a whole hell of a lot cheaper to do, and that there is the potential for this to lead to a trans-disciplinary publishing house finded directly by the systems which use it almost exclusively.

What I am imagining, then, are consortia of schools paying for the cost of accepting, publishing, editing, and reviewing scholarly books, a system of subscription and grant-funded publishing which utilizes: 1) ultimately, the academy is a system of self verification; 2) The idea that a book about 7th century monk or some such topic needs to be presented for a "popular" audience is both condencending and inane; 3) The days of a $100 book are about to go the way of Andrew Dice Clay, Andrew WK, and Yahoo. 

Don't get me wrong; starting "American Academic Press" or whatever would be no simple task. It would also take a huge sum of money and a small army of editors, academics, lawyers, and IT people to get started properly. But it has the potential to gaurd against decay by having no pretense of either profit or broad audience. Its biggest weakness might be that it will allow the system of publish-or-perish to continue-- but that seems to be a seperate problem.
