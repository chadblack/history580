Here are the questions I would like to ask during class today.

> 1)Do you agree with Manovich's claim that there is a "danger that we will interpret 'interaction' literally, equating it with physical interaction...at the expense of  psychological interaction (57)?"  Is discussing interactivity and computer-based media mere "tautology (55)?" Does Manovich give enough weight to interactivity in his book?

>2)	What is the role of Narrative in DH? Is DH a “database interface” or a “game algorithm?” (218-225) Does he satisfactorally define "database" as a cultural entity?

>3)	What is the distinction drawn by Manovich between cinema’s role of “recording perception” and the “computer [screen‘s] [function] as the record of memory” (325) and how does this impact Digital Humanities? To what extent should we DH'ers worry about the “aesthetics of density” (327)?

>4) What do you think of Manovich's approach to the cultural inheritance of new media? (HT: Matt Blaylock's post) Do you think he over-privileges visual media, especially cinema, when drawing comparisons?
