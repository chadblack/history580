# Print Proposal: "Feudalism and Bias in American History"
by Greg Bearringer

## Introduction
Alexander de Tocqueville, when comparing American democracy to feudal society, found democracy wanting. His discussion includes an interesting point of contrast-- the *feudal* system:   "Nothing was closer than the bond linking Vassal to Lord in the feudal world… democracy relaxes social bonds but tightens natural ones. It brings kin closer together while at the same time driving citizens further apart."[^1]  It strikes the eye and ear uncomfortably to see feudalism as anything more positive than a neutral description of the economic system of Medieval Europe.[^2] This paper will argue that this anti-feudal bias in fact comes to us from all the way back in the American colonies. 

In fact,  it is easy to see an increasing consciousness of the concept of "feudalism"  in the decade preceding the revolution:

A cursory search reveals that what we now think of as medieval europe was, in fact, conceived of as *feudal* europe in America:

## Plan

This paper will follow a very specific progress delineated below:


* Using using variety of textual-analysis tools as well as  pre-existing archives, I propose to look at the use of "feudal" and the concept of the Middle Ages during the period between 1750 and 1900, which will encapsulate the period before the revolution and as well as after the American Civil War, when "feudal" became a key term in the argument over economic and cultural superiority between the north and the south. 

* Using this evidence,  paper will argue is that, immediately prior to the American revolution, Americans began to think of Europe in terms of its "feudal" heritage; furthermore, this "feudalism" was  a relationship of economic subjugation and was described as a legal system supporting the King.  Furthermore, this paper will argue that after the revolution, this language was assumed by those discussing the increasingly bifurcated economic system of the United States: northern manufacturing and southern agrarian society. 

*  After a review of related projects, this paper will attempt to establish a simple logic and methodology for dealing with the mass of information available and how to draw reasonable conclusions from it.   In many ways, this paper will be about the process of digital textual analysis, and may be considered an exploration of the advantages and limitations of such an approach.  

## Sources
This paper will be utilizing extant databases as the source of its textual analysis. Google's Ngram Viewer project will, as demonstrated above, offer a useful starting heuristic to guide my research as well as a useful starting place when searching for specific non-periodical texts. [The Library of Congress' Chronicling America: Historical American Newspapers Archive](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/) and the [19th Century Digital Newspapers](http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/0/1/1/purl=rc6_NCNP?sw_aep=knox61277) will provide a strong corpus of newspapers to measure the popular dissemination of relevant terms. [America's Historical Imprints](http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/Evans?p_product=EAIX&p_action=keyword&p_theme=eai&p_nbid=O53L56QLMTM4MTE3MDUyNC44ODQzMzQ6MToxMzoxOTIuMjQ5LjEuMTM5&p_clear_search=yes&d_refprod=EAIX&) and [The Early Americas Digital Archive]( http://mith.umd.edu//eada/)  Will be particularly useful when tracking down early American texts.

# Digital Proposal: Medieval Blog
by Greg Bearringer


## Introduction: Academic Blogging
Academic Blogging is a grab bag of intelligent people, exciting research,  and interesting discussion, interesting to both professionals and non-professionals. alike Conversely,  one could read for many years from academic blogs and find low-content, outdated web pages and a not-suprising tendency toward insularity,  often focusing on a particular group of scholars or a particular department. Scientific and "political"  disciplines (Poli Sci, Economics, Law ) having (perhaps) natural advantages, with technology being so important to the former and social media coming more natural to the latter. 

History/ Humanities blogging, in general, shares many of these characteristics. Most are presentations of research with a sprinkling of hoary warnings of job market doom.  There are some very good websites, however, which follow this format: [Hooke's London](http://hookeslondon.com/), [Wynkn De Worde](http://sarahwerner.net/blog/), and [Magistra Et Mater](http://magistraetmater.blog.co.uk/), to name only a few.  

There are very few blogs, however, which might serve as a "hub" of blogging for a particular discipline or field. This is to be expected, however. Though academics have a particular interest in keeping abreast with the happenings within their field (and are naturally an opinionated lot) they usually don't have time to cultivate a blog regularly which keeps track of news stories, events, books, and broader concerns within the discipline and the academy. They are forced to do so when particular inspiration strikes. This makes for very well written posts, but not for the regularly-generated content which successful blogs require for a larger audience. 

It seems like academics would be particularly interested in a well kept blog which provided them with "daily links" and news pertinent to their particular field. Furthermore, if this content could be supplemented with useful introductions to the research of others through book reviews, comments on articles,  and information about new research approaches, it might have a (relatively) large audience available to it. 

## Audience 

The audience would be people with an academic interest in Medieval studies, with special attention paid to happenings in higher education and related research approaches. 


## Approach and Content
![](/http://dilbert.com/dyn/str_strip/000000000/00000000/0000000/000000/70000/4000/100/74148/74148.strip.gif)

This blog will have three methods of content generation, which will be listed in order of feasibility (within the time frame of this project)

1) Find relevant news stories and links and post about them regularly with basic commentary:  

  **Three Examples**:
        [Instapundit](http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/); [MGoBlog's *Unverified Voracity*](http://mgoblog.com/category/post-type/unverified-voracity);  [Chronicle of Higher Education's *The  Ticker*](http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/)
   
2) Attempt to engage in broader topics concerning Medieval studies, including but not limited to: new areas of research, pertinent news about academia-at-large, job news, and introductory commentary on new books/articles. 

3) Attempt to acquire advance reader copies (ARC's) of books for review online. This will be the trickiest, and I will be interested in the feed back I get in my attempts to do this. ARC's are not impossible to get, but they are usually sent to fairly established readers and publications. 

Most of the content, which would be largely generated from outside and acquired through two very simple and very effective tools: Google news alerts as well as an RSS feed of other blogs and websites related to Medieval studies. 

## Platform, Design, and Interest Generation

I will probably use WordPress as the platform for the blog, as it is by far the simplest platform to begin with and is one I have a high level of familiarity with. Design will be simple, straight forward, and content focused; only slightly less minimalist than [this site](http://dh.chadblack.net).  Meta!

Interest generation will involve simple search engine optimization (SEO), mainly utilizing tools offered WordPress and very straightforward and rigid tagging strategy-- any "proper" noun gets tagged. As with all things these days, Twitter would be the primary tool of "marketing" the site, with a help from other, professional sites like LinkedIn and Academia.edu. 

## What  is a successful Academic (subject) blog? 

The purpose of this blog would not be to fill a niche inside the discipline. Instead, this blog would be an experiment to see just how difficult it is to create a website using such an approach, and whether there is as great a desire for a site like this as I perceive. How much labor is involved with a website which, as conceived, would be updated a minimum of three times per week? How difficult is it to gain readership when the blog is aimed at a very small subset of society?  Is readership the only standard of success?
