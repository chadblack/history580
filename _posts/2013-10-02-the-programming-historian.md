## 
As the name suggests, The Programming Historian is an aggregate site devoted to computer tools that are useful for doing digital history. None of the tools are hosted by the site itself, but it contains all the relevant links with detailed articles on how to use them. In addition, each article contains a comment forum for general comments and any emergency troubleshooting. 

The topics covered by the site include such things as data manipulation, "web scraping" (automating your computer to search for things within defined parameters and download them from the net), and topic modeling. Most of the tools necessary for these tasks require the user to know some code, or at the very least to be comfortable working outside of the windows interface and on a computer's C: command propmpts. 

While the article authors are all very tech savvy, they are also historians, and are clearly used to communicating with people like myself who are far less technologically sophisticated. Until this week I had only ever opened my windows command prompt on accident, and had then quickly closed it as I had no idea what to do with it. I decided to try the "Topic Modelling" tutorial, and while there is more than one way to do this, the site teaches you how to use MALLET, a tool which allows you to input a large amount of text and then search for word or phrase patterns. 

MALLET is run from the C:\ command propmpt, entirely outside of the windows interface. However, the instructions were detailed, clear, and easy to follow. I made a few mistakes, but I was eventually able to run the program, inputting some sample texts to run a test model. There is no reason these tools should not be accessible to more historians, and each article includes examples of studies that used the tecnique under discussion. 

In addition to demonstrating the potential of these digital tools, each article also considers the possible ways the results can be misread or misused, as well as a discussion of the limits of the methods in question. For my purposes, topic modelling could be useful as I continue to look at Christian polemical works about the Prophet Muhammad. I envision being able to input a number of these texts and then running an analysis that will hopefully highlight connections between them that might not be revealed through more traditional techniques. 

However, for the purposes of this class I think it is useful to consider what any given results actually tells us. While these tools are more technologically sophisticated than traditional techniques, they require no less interpretation. What do the numbers on the spreadsheet actually allow me to say? And how do I make that case to an audience that might not understand how they were derived? In addition, for historians like myself who cannot pull, for example, large amounts of text from the internet, what are the limits of a tool like this? Unless I want to type out all of these texts by hand, I will be forced to rely on OCR technology which is useable but primarily for languages based on a latin alphabet. Scholars working with texts in languages like Arabic will find it much harder to use this kind of technology. This would seem to create  artificially restricted source bases. How do we factor this into our interpretation of any results?
