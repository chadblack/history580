## Perception

It seems so strange that reading this book that the two reactions I had were “That’s fascinating” and “I am not sure why this book seems important.”  It’s a book that invites its reader to like it, but does so in the most unsatisfying way: it is a book which appears to want to say something about everything and, in doing so, says not so much as it seems to appear. Furthermore, he pays mere lip service to the concept of interactivity without developing it past the point of specialized movie watching.

My biggest and most substantive concern with Manovich can be used as an example of what is interesting and infuriating about his work. He seems to separate “database” (which he describes as, “[representing] the world as a list of items and it [refusing] to order this list”) from “narrative” (which “Creates a cause and effect trajectory of seemingly unordered items” in a cultural setting. While this seems like an interesting point, by “narrative” he seems to mean simply “authorial intent.” If this is not what he means, then he is making a really good point about something impossible; narrative isn’t simply authorial intent, it is also the way people interact with the world around them, either by creating order where there is none available, or by contextualizing the randomness by elision. We can call a mass of cotton and synthetic fibers on the floor as three socks, a pair of shorts and two shirts— or as a pile of laundry. On their own, unperceived, they “refuse to be ordered” I suppose, but upon any interaction with them people who have some knowledge of clothing will immediately classify the pile either as individual parts or as a whole; either way, they will make some sense of how managed to get onto the floor. 

Assuming he is talking about authorial intent, then his point isn’t that “database is a challenge to narrative” but it is to the author. And “database”, which he admits is a “structured collection of data” 
simultaneously “refuses to order itself”? Even if this is true, it ignores the aforementioned interaction of people with data: they reflexively narrate. 

Of course, I cannot escape the feeling that I am missing something, so an internet search turned up Soft Cinema, a project by Manovich where he allows a computer to access a database of film, text, and images and presents them and edits them in real time, allowing for what he calls an “Infinite” combinations if this process was allowed to continue forever. 

The problem in these videos (clip here: http://vimeo.com/15473078) is that all that I ended up paying attention to was the part of the screen where the video was being presented. Rest of the images were elided into the background—not as a part of the narrative of the film, not even as something which was anti-narrative, but something which I only noticed because I was conscious of my need to experience the whole screen. Whatever impact the computer generated movie had wasn’t meaningful; it was random, a pile of laundry and something to be elided into a seprate narrative.

Interesting link I found about generating Narrative from Data:
