As a cultural historian, Manovich’s work poses some interesting questions about the connection between the new media he defines, and its relationship to a larger cultural inheritance.  Because Manovich argues that new media falls directly within a process of cultural development, a process including print, painting, and most importantly, cinema, as well as being an outgrowth of a post-industrialist, post cold war, capitalist society, he situates new media within a specific timeframe while still ascribing it a history within a larger cultural process.

To me, this seems somewhat problematic to understanding new media as each characteristic, though valid, in some ways counteract the importance of the other.  For example, media develops in a chronological fashion much in the way Manovich relates in his work. By adding new media to this long and constantly evolving development, Manovich does a good job of developing what I would consider to be New Media’s cultural inheritance.   Without its precursors, new media would not be what it is or exist at all. 

However, he also situates it within a specific economic and political context.  Of course this is necessary when explaining any type of cultural development, as without the right components at the right time, it is unlikely that that media will take off or develop at all.  In the case of new media, therefore, a problem emerges, as most cultural developments are categorized not by their acceptance within the lasting cultural development, but rather by that historical context which marked its emergence.

Usually, location is a primary signifier of how this categorization will take place.  For instance, Manovich often references the Renaissance as part of new medias lineage, but he fails to really examine the myriads of renaissances, with little r’s, which made up the big one.  In fact, the Renaissance, the big R version, is really the Italian Renaissance as the economic and political atmosphere of the time saw the emergence of this new artistic era.  An outgrowth took place and the ideals and stylistic elements reached other areas, but it is still trapped within a specific historical and geographic location.  That’s why the Italian Renaissance and the northern renaissance both differ in time and place, but also style.   The importance of these categorizations has been central within art history. Art historians formulate much of the art theory which functions as the foundation of the field by utilizing differences and similarities based on these categories.   

This tendency to link cultural development with geography seems important when considering the development of new media.  Because the emergence of a digital cultural does not require the same connectedness with place, at least to the same degree it did in past cultural developments, how will its place within art history make sense?  Has Manovich underemphasized place within the cultural development of new media?  Are digital humanities really global or do specific places influence them?  Can it fit as easily within larger cultural developments as Manovich posits?
