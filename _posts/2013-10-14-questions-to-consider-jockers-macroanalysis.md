Hey all,  

Here are some questions to consider. Apologies for the delay in posting them. 


1)	On page 8 Matthew Jockers contrasts  “close reading” with research techniques that use “big data”? Is this dichotomy a meaningful one? Does his description of “close reading” reflect the practice of *doing* history?

2)	On page 17, the author claims that the reluctance to adopt digital methods has been the result of “thinking small” and a lack of technical expertise? Considering the other works we’ve read, is this fair? 

3)	Throughout the book Jockers uses economic metaphors and terminology. Is this appropriate? 

4)	Do this book and Galloway’s Protocol complement each other? Are these authors part of the same conversation? Or are they talking against/across each other?

5)	On pages 25-27, Jockers lists the special insights that he believes “big data” and digital methods offer. At this point in the semester are you convinced? Do you believe digital methods are the best way to accomplish these goals? 

6)	In the second part of the book Jockers includes several charts and graphs, page 43 for example. Are these meaningful? Is it clear how the author derived his results? And are his conclusions convincing?
