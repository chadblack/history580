## Fun with Narrative

One thing occured to me as I was putting together my presentation on the WayBack Machine: how fun it might be to use this to generate a narrative.

Let's take, for example, the website of our fine institution: http://web.archive.org/web/19961119231554/http://www.utk.edu/. Nothing particularly spectacular here; welcome to the web in 1996. For a comparison, let's use Harvards web site in December 1997: http://web.archive.org/web/19971211223954/http://www.harvard.edu/. Once again, nothing to write home about. Fast forward to February 2001: [UTK](http://web.archive.org/web/20010224170544/http://www.utk.edu/) ; [Harvard](http://web.archive.org/web/20010224172928/http://www.harvard.edu/):  . Fairly comperable, right?  June, 2004: [UTK](http://web.archive.org/web/20050624020308/http://www.tennessee.edu/) ; [Harvard](http://web.archive.org/web/20040510043612/http://www.harvard.edu/). 

Now, for a point of comparison, lets go to December 2010: [UTK](http://web.archive.org/web/20100925122606/http://www.utk.edu/). Is this the best and most intuitive website in the world? Not really. But it is highly functional, and has a easily availible link to important things like email and prospective students. Now, welcome to [2012's website](http://web.archive.org/web/20120201171915/http://www.utk.edu/). Gone is the emphasis on function and enter the emphasis on form: literally, the first thing you see (and saw) when arriving at the page was "WELCOME TO YOUR BRAND". Three of the top headlines on the site have to do with the "Branding Campaign" launched by the university, which resulted in that combination of  curious looks,overly-dramatic over-reaction, and complete apathy that only a college campus can produce.  I remember that, at least in my little corner of OIT the reaction ranged from complete frustration to quiet grumbling as this nearly-unavigable jumble was foisted upon the university. 

For comparison, however, let's see [Harvards site](http://web.archive.org/web/20111101231504/http://www.harvard.edu/) from around a few months before. It is certainly easier to get around this site-- but only slightly. Outside of the header, the site looks more like a tumblr blog than an institution website-- or, at least, like an institution website ought to be run. 

While it might be easy to see UT-K's 2012 shift as one of style over substance (and, in fact, brazenly was), I think that it also revealed something not-so-secret about today's web: whether you use [Google](http://web.archive.org/web/20011215012025/http://www.google.com/), [Yahoo](http://web.archive.org/web/19961017235908/http://www2.yahoo.com/), or [Lycos](http://web.archive.org/web/19961025120541/http://www.lycos.com/)(Which apparently still exists; these links are all the earliest captures availible through the wayback machine), people aren't using a website's interface to find specific items on the web anymore. If you want to find Volmail on our website, good luck; however, most people only ever have to find it once before a book mark or browser history save it all for them-- or they simply use an email client (or "app", which everything has to be referred to as now). Want to know about a professor? You can either spend 39 clicks trying to find the history department from utk.edu, actually learn the sites url (history.utk.edu, as it turns out), or just search for it via a search engine. While this has turned out to me much more efficient for most people, the trade off is that the interface of most websites have de-emphasized navigabiltiy and have substituted a webpage oriented toward something that can only be called "marketability". 

Tonight, we get to "Drudge" through the dark, scary, and ill-designed history of the web. Fun times!
