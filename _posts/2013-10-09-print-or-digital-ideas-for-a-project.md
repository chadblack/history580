## Project Ideas

### Digital Project 


For my digital project, I would like to create a website dedicated to US political radicalism in the US from 1965-1985. I think Omeka will be the best format for my project. Because of the time restraints, I will focus on a number of individuals/organizations that played influential roles during these two decades. The year 1965 is very important to US history, particularly because of the radical shift in the Civil Rights Movement that eventually led to what many academics refer to as the ‘Black Power’ movement. In 1965, local organizers attempted, three times, to lead a march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. After a violent response by state and local officials, the first attempt became known as Bloody Sunday. Martin Luther King, Jr. and SCLC went on to lead, successfully the later attempts in hopes of garnishing national support for voting rights. This caused conflict with many student organizers, particularly SNCC and Stokely Carmichael who wanted more direct action and political control. This caused Carmichael and others to take a detour to Lowndes County, Alabama in hopes of establishing what they referred to as Black power. Lowndes was in the heart of the blackbelt and despite 81% of the population being Black none were capable of voting. Establishing political power in these areas was the main goal of Black power, but the concept later took on an entirely new meaning. 

In 1966, the Black Panther Party was created in the slums of Oakland. Most of the urban ghettos did not gain anything from the success of the Civil Rights Movement. Inspired by Carmichael’s work in Lowndes, Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale created their own political organization that would reshape radical politics in the US. The goal was no longer similar to the goals of the Civil Rights Movement—capitalist reform. Instead, the Panthers wanted to change the structure of US politics and economics completely. The US responded very violently. After efficiently neutralizing the Panthers, many radical offshoots were created and most were inspired by US involvement in Vietnam and revolutions taking place throughout the Third World. Urban guerrilla warfare was ‘adopted,’ but quickly dismantled by the US government. Some of these organizations include the Black Liberation Army, the Weather Underground, the May 19th Communist organization, and the Symbionese Liberation Army. 

For my project, I would like to provide primary and secondary sources for many of these individuals and organizations. It is fairly difficult to find online databases and websites that describe these issues in a scholarly manner. An interactive map will be provided in order to have a better understand of where and how these organizations functioned. Most importantly, I will attempt to provide access to many speeches and writings by these individuals so they can be heard in their own words. I will provide context surrounding each exhibit and an analytical take on historical implications. 

Hopefully the final product will be of help to many researchers and students interested in US Marxist thought and history. 

### Print Project 

I would like to utilize the University of California, Berkeley’s online database for my print project. There is a portion of the website dedicated to the Black Panther Party and its political activism beginning in the 1960s and ending in the 1980s. The database has also collected information regarding members and leaders after the collapse of the party. Many of those who were not killed or incarcerated remained fairly active in politics. I would like to use data analysis to understand the changes in shifts in goals and politics. News articles and speeches, both old and new, have been digitized making transcripts very accessible and easy to analyze.
