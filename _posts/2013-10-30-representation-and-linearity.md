## A discursive discourse

>"These tools allow visual perception to be harnessed in the dynamic processes associated with the creation or discovery of new knowledge." [Martyn Jessop](http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/3/281.abstract)

It annoys me to no end when I hear people assume that Christianity was the [reason for a lack of scientific discovery during the middle ages](http://youtu.be/prZXNhIG5js). While there are a number of reasons this gets  my goat, the main is that it shows a lack of understanding about how scientific advancements are made. For one: observation is kind of important, and the kind of observation necessary for advanced medicine or the like is a process which took thousands of years. Math is also pretty important too. Germ theory (which, by the way, gets its very name from a passage in Galen) couldn't happen without the microscope. That Democritus established the earliest known theory (the basic understanding of which are more or less correct, except the whole "indestructable" thing) of the atom was more of a stroke of random luck that anything like "science" as it ought to be understood. 

The common planetary model of the atom is much older than the close, direct observation of it, and is in fact not an accurate representation of reality; the "cloud" model is much more accurate. However, in physics classes today the planetary model is still common, and that is because it has one thing which is key to the endurance of a representational model: it has utility. Trying to figure out why a carbon atom combines with two oxygen atoms is easy when you have a model like, say [this one](http://d1jqu7g1y74ds1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/c-atom_e1.gif), but not quite as easy to explain with words alone.  In other words, the utility of this rudimentary model doesn't portray an entirely accurate model of the atom, but it eliminates information which obfuscates the simple understanding of how various "shells" within an atomic cloud interact with other atoms based on the number of electrons contained within. An incomplete picture is more effective in communicating this information than accurate mathematical or graphical representation.

>The way in which new practices spread through a population depends in large part onthe fact that people inﬂuence each other’s behavior. In short, as you see more and more people doing something, you generally become more likely to do it as well. Understanding why this happens, and what its consequences are, is a central issue for our understanding of networks and aggregate behavior.

>"Historians’ embrace of Lefebvre has been partial. They pay, I think, more attention to the language of spatiality than to the spatial experience, but many of the projects on this web site are more interested in spatial experience and spatial practice than language, and this has forced us to ask some hard questions." [Richard White](http://www.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=29)

There is something about modern life that make people wax poetic, attempting to come up with a narrative to explain *how* modern life went from 1900 to the second millennia, and also as a method to describe its difference. This is a natural reaction to any significant phenomena, but I take issue with the nomenclature. One of the best and (to my mind) most problematic discussions of this is Alan Liu's article, ["When was linearity? The meaning of Graphics in the digital age"](http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/essays/liuessay.php) I agree with his premise: that the idea that the world, culture, and human experience has gone from "linear" to "non-linear" is false precisely because it is a false representation of how those in the past thought. The question I wished that he had asked was this: what does linearity mean and why did this term come to represent whatever it means?

You might think I don't grasp what he means, but in fact he notes the simple contradiction himself: "Linear vs. non-linear, for example, is not actually homologous with textual vs. visual, since innumerable instances of non-linear text and linear visuals scramble the circuits. Most fundamentally, graph lies at the undecidable etymological root of both linear graphemic writing and multiaxial graphics." Linear thought, actually, is 'step-by-step' thinking, where one thing follows logically from another and is followed by another because of understandable and sufficient reasons:

 The problem with this type of logic thus described is obvious, but I think that this misrepresents how linear thought is actually done. Certainly, most history books *could* be summed up in a simple fashion:
 
 1. Status Quo
 2. Some Phenomena
 3. Difference

However, that is obviously a representation and not an actual thought pattern. Linear representation is actually very easy. Cause(s) and effect thought, as actually done, is usually a much more complicated process. Just because a book is a single line of thought does not mean that it is "simple", or (more germane to this argument) somehow entirely inflexible. 

I am taking a lot of words to offer one reminder about linear vs. non-linear thought: "graphical" representation serves to make things more simple, not more complex. If this wasn't the case, they wouldn't last very long.  Modularity requires standardization, and the idea which he espouses-- that modularity is to be free-- strikes me as fundamentally wrong. The modularity of a cog only offers it the freedom to be used in another machine. Modularity is not malleability. What ever else you say about linear thought, it is a system which is naturally malleable, even though it is not modular (especially in practice). If step one changes in the image above, then it step 2 will have to change even if the original step two will have to be cast aside. 

My critique, finally, is this: linear thought is a different animal than linear conclusions/representations; the latter is always going to be a much more simplistic model than reality appears to support. "Non-linear" thought, however, is simply assumed to be more sophisticated simply because it represents complexity more directly. In other words, it appears more complex precisely since it excludes summation by definition. "Its not as easy as that," (my gross oversimplification of the non-linear though model) is a statements which has been used to describe highly complex physics and how to tie your shoes. It is a statement that sacrifices contingent argument at the alter of fastidious accuracy. 

PS: I hope you didn't read the above yet, because I found almost the exact same argument I was trying to make made in a legible and intelligent way here: ["In defense of the Linear Model: and Essay"](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733309001899/pdfft?md5=394efb1f50c8029a1097e323ee1a8db9&pid=1-s2.0-S0048733309001899-main.pdf) :

> •First, we claim that the LM – as usually referred to – is a rather oversimplified version of a much richer and subtler set of propositions. Moreover, these propositions are not necessarily and logically linked to each other. Critiques are advanced in some cases towards some of these propositions and against all of them in other instances. Much criticism of the linear model remains however often undisciplined and generic, including incoherent or mutually contradictory arguments.   •Second, we argue that not all the critiques are really destructive and that many of the standard objections to the linear model might be easily accommodated within it.
  •Third, we claim that the really destructive critique to the LM has to do with the recognition of the systemic, dynamic, interactive nature of innovation. At the same time, however, we raise a warning that critiques along this line run the risk of leading to an alternative model (as extreme as the standard version of the LM) ‘where everything depends on everything else’, if the specific structure of the system is not fully and clearly specified.   
  •Fourth, we argue that the linear model as such does not imply any specific normative prescription (except a rather general support to basic research) and therefore it should not be blamed on these grounds.
