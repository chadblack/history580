## Get them before they're gone: new tools for the humanities

This week’s readings provided several ways of looking at new tools and methodologies for the humanities. Space and time have always had their role in the field, but digital technology allows historians to better manipulate them for the purpose of research. 

Richard White’s “What is Spatial History?” and Martyn Jessop’s “Digital visualization as a scholarly activity” take different approaches to explaining the digital humanities than many of our readings from the past several weeks. Both willingly admit their roles in the digital humanities are not revolutionary at all, but rather they are providing tools to further advance the field and the quality of research produced. White primarily discussed space in his article.  Space is something, according to White, that humans produce over time (7). “We produce and reproduce space through our movements and the movements of goods that we ship and information that we exchange. . . spatial relations are established through the movement of people, plants, animals, goods, and information” (17). White then offered over a dozen figures on the different types of influence spatial history can provide. 

These projects are different than typical illustrations used in historical works according to White. A question to consider is whether or not this claim holds any validity. Also, how can these types of projects influence and advance the humanities and social sciences? 

Jessop also takes the stance that digital visualization and illustrations are not inherently revolutionary.  Thought processes have always been enhanced by graphic aids—the digitization has only amplified this interpretation. 

Another question to consider: According to Jessop, graphic aids and representations are age-old tools in the humanities. Does this automatically counter any claim that digital humanities are something revolutionary? Or are we simply gaining access to and bettering our arsenal of tools already in place?  How does this influence research methodology? 

One question Jessop raises in the text is also very interesting: If the majority of images in print are already referred to as illustrations, what is the difference between illustrations and visualizations? The answer provided is that visualizations are interactive, allows manipulation of geographical representation and data. According to Jessop, illustration only serves to support written language. Is this a sufficient answer or is it more complex? 

The Salem Witch Trials were used as an example of implementing GIS technology into documenting historical study. Is this not revolutionary? It seems as we progress through the course, I’m beginning to believe the digital is or possibly can reconfigure many of the ways we as historians do things. To go as far as to say it is revolutionary, that I am not sure. During the first half of the course, I always found myself trying to understand the physical make-up of the digital technology while pretending all of the abstract components were irrelevant. The examples provided by White and Jessop definitely forced me to reconsider that position, despite their reluctance to join the ‘digital-is-revolutionary’ bandwagon. 

One problem I had with the Jessop text was the urge to define and create a structure that governs the digital humanities. If it were not revolutionary, as Jessop believes, why would it need this system in place? Is this not the same as what we’ve seen with some of the past works we’ve read when theorists strongly demand their study be recognized as a new field? It’s important to understand that the digital does need to be implemented into historical methodology correctly, but I’m not quite sure this is necessary, especially if these things are only tools. 

 
Weingart’s “Demystifying Networks” and Networks, Crowds, and Markets by David Easley Jon Kleinberg explore the idea of digital networks. Weingart takes on the task of directly applying digital networks to the humanities while Easley and Kleinberg provide an overall framework on understanding interdependent units within networks and the process that result in the outcomes of those relationships. 

Weingart’s work is a shortened version of Networks, Crowds, and Markets. It has also been mostly reshaped for the humanities understanding. Weingart notes that networks can be applied to everything but should not be applied to just anything. He makes it understood that networks are assortments of ‘stuff’ that can be arranged or separated into lists or categories. This ‘stuff’ is called nodes and is always very concrete in definition. By the nature of the research in humanities, data is hardly ever concrete as Weingart pointed out. This complicates matters further—a reduction of data must take place to fit the data into categories.

Easley and Kleinberg go further in depth on explaining how networks and their structures work. Structural balance and triadic closure are two main themes discussed in this section. Triadic closure happens when two members of a network, independently related to another member, become related themselves through the other member. Structural balance, or being unbalanced, happens when one member of the network is related to two other members that cannot function together. 

More questions to consider: How can game theory influence humanist studies? It is outlined in detailed how it relates to many of the social and natural sciences, but not so much when it comes to the humanities. 

Chapters 16 and 18 seem very valuable to the humanities. Is the idea of herding not one we have used in the humanities, even prior to digital networking? Can the “rich-get-richer” phenomena be further influenced or supported by current historical research methods. If so, are these qualitative approaches now very valuable to the humanities?
