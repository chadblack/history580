##Statistics, Humanities, and Digital History

As a baseball fan, I am very aware of the dissonance between "old time" baseball fans and a new generation of sabermerically inclined fans who have a statistically nuanced understanding of the game. The primary reason that "old time" baseball guys don't like the new-age stats is largly because it doesn't jive with how they watch a game of baseball. Where an old-fashioned baseball fan might watch a favorite player come up with a hit at a crucial moment of the game and see "clutch", a new-age stats guy might point out that, on the whole, "clutch" is non-exisistant, and that players tend to hit at a consistant rate no matter the situation. "Old-time" fans don't think that the stats-guys appreciate the human portion of the game, while the stats-guys see the old-timer's view as outdated, narrative dependant interpretation which makes up for its supposed advantage of experiential benefits  with a large disadvantage in the matter of interprative understanding. 

The reason I bring this up is partially in response to Matthew Kirschenbaum's comment about the frustration on the part of certain academics when they encounter "digitial humanities":

>Even more recently, I would argue, the network effects of blogs and Twitter at a moment when the academy itself is facing massive and often wrenching changes linked to both new technologies and the changing political and economic landscape have led to the construction of “digital humanities” as a free-floating signifier, one that increasingly serves to focus the anxiety and even outrage of individual scholars over their own lack of agency amid the turmoil in their institutions and profession.<

As I had a professor recently say, "Publishing is dead." Understandably, that scares many professors used to the "publish or perish" world of academia. Indeed, I am not sure anyone could predict with anything other than luck and vagueries what Academic publishing will be in twenty years. Of course, hidden amongst these fears is the notion that, as the president of my Undergraduate institution told the school's faculty, (and this is a heavy paraphrase) "Professors are no longer the primary dispensers of information to students." More than the fear of being outdated is the rampant fear that professors are about to be come nearly obsolete and far less of a personal presence in the lives of their students, little more than the man behind the digital curtain (which shields the student from the wizard). 

Of course, these fears are probably expressing more than just the suspicion of Digital Scholarship and the future intellectual property rights. But there is a vague sense amongst professor's I've talked to that the internet is as much a loss of control and discipline as it is an oportunity for advancement. 

While there is a kernel of truth to their fears-- afterall, Digital Humanities done poorly and irresponsibly is Humanities done poorly and irresponsibly-- there is also a very real misunderstanding of what digital humanities can  and cannot do that makes their fears very similar to the "old time" baseball fan's aversion to "statistics" based fandom. 

You see, digital humanities done correctly (in all its various forms) does exactly what statistics does to baseball-- it helps you understand something you might not otherwise have understood or even imagined. Unlike statistics and the common fan, however, digital humanities also travels the other direction-- it is a term which encompasses both the analysis and presentation of media in a manner which eludes analogy. While Kirschenbaum's chapter is useful in that it 
points out the basic reasons for learning what digital humanities is and why it should be studied-- essentially, convenience, public access, and funding-- we ought to remember that unless digital humanities can improve a messgae in at least one of these three ways (and, by definition, it ought to do the first two), then it is not simply a failed attempt, but a wasted opportunity to be the answer to much of what ails academia as a whole.
