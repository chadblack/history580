For my show and tell post, I wanted to highlight a database I use a lot in my own research, The Southern Oral History Program (SOHP), a part of the Center for the Study of the American South at UNC.  Although this database did not originate as an online resource, its real usefulness, I think, is how compatible it is to Internet usage.   Basically, the goal of the SOHP is to record and preserve the voices of the south and then make them open for research and scholarship.  This is done through multiple ways, including personal statements, field interviews, and collections of art and photographs.

Because the SOHP is made for research, it offers many useful search options to help a user find what they need.  This can be accomplished through the tabs at the top of the homepage.  For research purposes, the two must helpful tabs are oral histories and research.  The oral history tab allows a user to choose their preferred method of searching.  This can be done through browse the finding aid (this option has thematic series A-V with all relevant data grouped within each), search the interview database (a more user specific search based on your own word choices and the option of looking at different fields as well as a more general browse option than the previous one), or featured interviews.  In addition, the oral history tab also provides a link explaining the use and permissions of their data.

The research tab allows a user to work within the confines of topics most applicable to the SOHP.  These include, the long women’s movement, the long civil rights movement, the civil rights history project, media and the movement, the university history project, the legacy of William C. Friday, African American credit unions, and past projects.  Within each other, further links are offered which aid research on individual interests.

The site also offers a lot of useful non-text sources as well.  One of the most useful options it has provided me in my own research is the old photos and maps of NC.  (Ben you might want to check this out for your project)  However, it has much more than just photos.  In particular, the multi media aspect of the site provides some great images, videos, and recordings from real people and places in the south.

Because the site is intended to be used by serious scholars as well as those interested in the south in a more causal way, it is very user friendly and encourages use.  One ay it does this is through the teaching, engagement, & resources tab.  This tab helps those unfamiliar with the types of sources the SOHP uses an overview on what an oral history is, how they are collected, and how they are used.  This is a great resource for both educators and scholars.  

Overall, the SOHP is a great example of what can be done with a digital resource.  Although this database existed before the website, the usability and openness of it did not.  As I mentioned above, it is not only intended for scholars, before the Internet cite it was as it was located on UNC’s campus and was not as accessible to the nonacademic.  This demonstrates how the Internet and digital technology can affect the level of education and the dissemination of knowledge in a real way.
