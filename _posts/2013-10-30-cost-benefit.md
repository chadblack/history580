The "Becoming Digital" reading highlighted a few things that have been on my mind recently. It is scholarship season, and I've been applying for things like the Fulbright so that I can travel the world looking at manuscripts contained in archives that span six countries and two continents. Several of these archives are in countries like France and Italy. These are places I don't mind spending some time in. However, this costs money, money that I sometimes think might be better spent elsewhere. 

This brings me to the reading. Much of what the author(s) discuss is cost, both in terms of time and money. This is true. Digital projects are undoubtedly costly. However, once completed, they have the potential to have a far wider impact than anything my  or anyone elses individual forays will effect. In this time of budget crunches, and slashes in spending, is the traditional way of funding research really the most effective? What if the money spent on Fulbright grants each year was spent on funding the digitizing of archives instead? Or, what if all research grants were modernized to include a digital component as well? Any scholar sent to any particular archive must digitize the manuscripts/documents he or she uses? It seems like this might make it easier to justify the expense.

I'm not saying that individual research should be entirely done away with. I'm not even sure it should be changed at all. This reading has just made me think about the logistics involved in getting myself to all the places I need to go. For medievalists at least, there will always be situations where you need to see the physical object itself, but in many cases looking at a digitized manuscript would suffice. What about you more modern historians? How vital is it that you handle the physical object?
