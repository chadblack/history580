## A thought experiment

I have been trying to think of a good analogue for Mcluhan's claim that the "Medium is the Message" that will better help me understand it. I might have come up with one, thought whether it helps me understand him any better will be seen. 

Lets just jump into it, then: What if we replace "the medium" with "a gun" and the "message" with "the Bullet"? If we transfer his logic over, we would come up with an interesting parallel. While the "Bullet" is an incedental interaction with the gun, the gun itself is something which is both an extension of man (insert phallic joke here) and something which holds the psycological weight of the bullet, of violence, and of control through power. Sometimes, the gun (or something like a gun) an shoot paintballs or blanks or rubber bullets or potatoes-- but the psycological imapct, the physical reaction (a flinch, for instance) is something much more serious because of its association with the gun.

If my understanding of Mcluhan is correct, my basic problem is this: while the medium is key to the content and the accessability of a message, it is the messages themselves which determines the the impact of the medium. If the only guns we ever had squirted water, their psycological power would be something far different. If TV was only on for two hours a day and only produced something educational and intellectual, it would still have an interesting impact-- but the interest would not be nearly as varied. It is the exsitance of Advertising, of propaganda, of news channels, of polemical tirades and low-logic thinkers that makes the media of television, posters, pictures, and the internet something very frightening and powerful and wonderful at the same time. 

In otherwords, if Media is the extention of man, then we must remember that even if it is removed sevenfold, that man-- or, at least, something human-- is ultimately the message.
