The readings this week stimulated a few thoughts in no particular order: 
1)	By this point in the semester I’ve reached a point of exhaustion with any simplistic dichotomization of print v. digital. I think the readings this week, Kathleen Fitzpatrick’s in particular, did a better job than most of describing a more complex situation, but even this felt, at times, mired in between the two. The issue, as she points out, really is more about prestige and peer review than the physical form any particular scholarship takes. I truly believe any outright rejection/suspicion of all things digital is nothing more than a generational bias. For the rest of us, I think the issue is more about standardization, or lack of it. From my perspective, asking whether “print” is dead or “not dead” misses the point. Print has had the prestige that it does because of a peer review process and the standardizing of everything from style and grammar to form and layout. Such things not only minimize confusion and heighten clarity, but make it much easier to use scholarly monographs and articles as a reference tool. As soon as a reliable set of standards becomes the norm, I think there will be much less resistance to digital scholarship.
2)	I think the digital commons site we looked at last week made the most sense as a way to go forward. Just as their doesn’t need to be a dichotomy between print vs digital, digital publishing does not have to mean one thing.  I don’t see why we can’t combine public and anonymous peer review. In many ways we already do this. When an academic readies an article or monograph, it is rare that he or she hasn’t had it informally vetted beforehand. Whether in a dissertation reading group, broader reading group, conference, etc., most work goes through a sort of public review process before any anonymous review. It seems that media commons offers a way to share one’s work to varying degrees depending on where one is in the writing process.
