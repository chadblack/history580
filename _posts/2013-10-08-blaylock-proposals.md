Print Project:
My project is an examination of the 2,167 screen captures of the adovate.com located on the Wayback machine (http://web.archive.org/web/20130922063934/http://www.advocate.com/).    The Advocate is a leading LGBT magazine and offers a holistic look at gay life in America with political, social, economic, and entertainment articles.  As such, the headlines of the advocate.com’s homepage reflect some of the leading concerns in an LGBT American’s life when that capture was made.  I will utilize these screen captures in tandem with text analysis and clustering to see analyze two main points: leading LGBT issues and self-identification.  Of particular interest is how the start of a global LGBT community, through avenues like the advocate.com, changed the nature of the community itself.  I hope to understand how the ability to connect on a larger scale changed gay consciousness in America and how this in turn influenced advocacy.  Did LGBT citizens begin to view themselves collectively because of the internet?  If so, did this change the nature of their advocacy?  I will examine whether major issues presented on the homepage, such as an emphasis health, tolerance, equal rights, changed and whether subsequent changes occurred within the larger LGBT lexicon.  For example, the use of LGBT is a relatively new occurrence.  I want to explore when and how this took place and see if this related to the emergence of the internet itself.  I will look specifically at the shift from advocacy centered on AIDS, the Matthew Shepard case, and Gay Marriage and self-identification from gay to gay and lesbian to LGBT to Queer.   One possibility for this project is developing points of comparison.  This can be accomplished in a number of ways.  The first will be to compare the adovate.com with The Advocate, the print magazine, to see if language and issues change based on the medium.  Second, comparisons of the language used in regional LGBT journals or societies might shed light on whether this was a national trend or a regional phenomenon.  Equally, text analysis of the leading LGBT literature from the time and illuminate similar themes.  Last, comparing the analysis of the adovate.com with a non-LGBT magazine will highlight how these terms/lexicon and issues related to both a primarily gay audience and a primarily non-gay audience.

Internet Project:

My internet project draws heavily from the idea and implementation of Philaplace.org.  My intended project will focus on one of the protestant camps I examine in my historical research, Lake Junaluska Assembly.  This camp was developed in 1913 in Waynesville, NC, a small town in Western North Carolina.  A unique part of this camp was its architecture.  Lake Junaluska typically utilized a seasonal type of architecture, such as cottages on small plots and craftsman bungalows.  This difference in aesthetics and utilization of space developed a clear visual separation between Lake Juanluska and the larger Waynesville community.  In fact, this visual separation mirrored a larger social separation as residents of Lake Junaluska actively maintained their distance from local residents.  At the heart of this difference was a belief that national stereotypes about Appalachian residents (hillbillies, white trash, and rednecks) could be applied to the semi-permanent residents of Lake Junaluska if they became to enmeshed with the local community.  Therefore, a site like Philaplace would allow me to represent this community within a community in both a visual and textual form.  By embedding images of Lake Junaluska homes and brief biographies of their owners and their Waynesville counterparts from the same period (1913-1920), a map of the separation appears.  This would greatly aid my own research and help add credence to my argument as a depiction of the separation is the end result.
