## A New Post
While I share many of Matt and Jay's observations and concerns, I realized that what most excites me about this class is the prospect of trying something no one has ever tried before, and possibly failing at it spectacularly. I find most of what we do as academics worthwhile and compelling. However, there are times when the *stuff* we do also feels restrictive and confining. No matter how interesting the topic or fresh the approach, one still finds oneself follwing the well-worn conventional path established by the *guild*.   When one talks about failing in an academic sense, it is usually less about failing at something truly unique, and more about doing a shitty job at it. 
Digressing momentarily, I moved to San Francisco, CA shortly after graduating from high school, and spent almost a decade there as I completed my BA and MA with some meandering and boozing thrown in the mix. While Silicon Valley is not quite what it was a decade ago, it still casts a long shadow, and San Francisco remains a place where people interested in technology and the culture that comes with move to. Either personally or through friends, I knew lots of software engineers, game designers, and entrepreneurs looking to design the latest and greatest thing or push their latest iPhone app. While some of these people were more talented and creative than others, what they all seemed to have in common were pursuits that often led them into uncharted territory- areas where there were no guides, instruction manuals, or graduate seminars telling you the *right* way to go or the *correct* way to do something. Not every idea was successful -most in fact were not-, but the disproportionate number of 20something millionares wearing their hoodies and converse to trendy high-end restaurants testified to the fact that some were. I often asked myself how they managed it, and the answer was usually simple: they had an idea, they tried it, and they kept tinkering until it worked. 
All this is to say that I'm excited to be delving into an area that feels truly wide open. I'm not only curious to find out how I respond to being  untethered, but also the degree to which the more conventional skills I've learned in graduate school compliment or obstruct my ability to actualize the project(s) I have in mind.
