Print Project:

Carl Bridenbaugh's 1963 work Mitre and Sceptre points to American fear of the establishment of an Anglican Episcopate in the colonies as one of the primary elements leading into the Imperial political crisis which ultimately resulted in revolution. Religious fear, and most especially virulent anti-catholicism had long been a staple of American political and religious life from the 1630's onward. By the 1750's, however, attentive religious fear of French and Spanish Catholics had begun to evolve into more broad reservations about state religious establishments and encroaching religious authority. After the French were largely defeated in North America in the Seven-Years War (French and Indian War), the loss of a visible French Catholic presence coupled with growing British desires to finish the settling of state Anglicanism in the colonies; in essence finishing a task half-heartedly begun a century earlier. On one hand, American fear of British religious authority and the transplanting of Anglican power to the colonies was but a subordinate part of the larger questions surrounding British political power and legitimacy in the colonies. However, the expression of this fear was done largely in preexisting anti-Catholic terminology and symbolism. This project will rely on keyword and key-phrase analysis to look at the prevalence of anti-Catholic rhetoric in the colonial print culture from 1750-1773. In so doing, it will harness the power of text analysis and online databases to contextualize the meaning of this anti-catholic rhetoric after a perceived Catholic threat had passed. This will provide some insight into the ways in which preceding religious fears and rhetorical expressions found their way into the political and religious debates surrounding a supposedly "native" British Protestant establishment in the colonies, which largely consisted of Anglican dissenters. Tracing these expressions by publication date and place will also provide a spatial reference to the spread of these ideas from Puritan New England to the rest of the colonies which lacked the unified established religious culture and strong ties between the secular and sacred that New England exhibited.

and wordle,

this project will turn to digitized sermons, broadsides, and editorials from this period to trace the inter-colonial, imperial, and transatlantic spread of these ideas as they began to constitute more and more of a political concern within the British colonies. It will also speculate on which terms held the most symbolic political meaning, and whether these meanings had a direct influence on the perception, real or imagined, of encroaching religious authority within and without the empire that might ultimately pose a threat to a distinctly American religious sensibility. 


Digital Project: 

My digital project is closely related to the print project, in that it will also consider the spread of rhetoric surrounding religious fear and anti-catholicicism in the pre-revolutionary American colonies. However, where the print project is tied to understanding the prevalence, meanings, and utility of this rhetoric, the digital project seeks to define spatially how and where this rhetorical spread occurred. 
Using interactive mapping tools such as Zeemaps,

this project can trace the geographic spread of religious fear within the colonies. In so doing, it will prove visually whether, as contemporary British observers speculated, this fear of Anglicanism originated in Puritan New England and was exported to the other colonies by Boston's powerful print industry or, as my own research suggests, anti-Anglicanism was retrofitted onto previously extent anti-catholic rhetoric across the breadth of British America in order to negotiate changing political factors that presented a newly perceived threat to various colonial religious loyalties and establishments. Finding antagonism regarding religious establishments in 1760's Pennsylvania, for instance, might have more to do with Quaker antipathy to the Massachusetts Congregationalists than it did with Anglican Episcopal efforts initiated by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. Insights such as these might suggest religious fear as a long standing political and social tool of identity formation and social cohesion rather than an explicit reaction to specific religious efforts within the empire.
