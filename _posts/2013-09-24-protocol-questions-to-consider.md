title: "Protocol: Questions to Consider"
---

1.	Galloway highlights the origin of the Internet as its subsequent decentralization to the Cold War.  This military necessity seems to influence the type of language and analysis Galloway extends to the Internet.  Is his focus on this development still relevant to the Internet today or has Galloway overemphasized the military aspects of this work?  Does this in turn cloud any analysis of protocol, decentralization, and the future of the Internet?
2.	Galloway posits that despite opinions to the contrary, the Internet does not offer a place of total freedom, but due to the constraints based on protocol is actually a rather controlled environment.  However, he also argues that many groups strive to utilize this framework to develop their own forms of media with clear agendas.  Does the act of resistance, even if developed within the protocols of the media being used, not challenge Galloway’s assertion?  Isn’t the very act of defiance a sign of freedom?
3.	Is the code we learned about in Petzold the same as protocol?  Should Galloway have provided more detail about the technical aspects of the Internet?  Can you ever sprite the technical from the theoretical in this context?
4.	Manovich developed a nuanced linkage between the Internet and the evolution of media with a emphasis on cinema.  The same connections seem absent from Galloway.  Should Galloway have considered the Internet in these same terms?  Whose analysis is more valid, why?
5.	Does Galloway’s analysis of the Internet conform to the McCluhan’s theories of new media?  Does this show that the Internet falls easily within the categorizations that McCluhan developed or does it highlight a flaw in his reasoning?
6.	The terminology of the Internet is often linked to the historical era in which it developed.  Consider this in relation to the emergence of computer viruses during the beginnings of the aids epidemic.   Can we ever separate from the larger historical context?  Does this mean that the Internet is always in flux?  Do analyzes of the Internet; therefore, need to be contextualized as well?  Is this different from other types of media?  Does this challenge Galloway’s argument? 
7.	Galloway ends his work by saying that protocol is good or bad based on a particular situation.  Is this problematic to his argument?  Should he be expected to argue for or against protocol, and therefore, control?
8.	Does Galloway undermine the role of the individual in his work by focusing largely on groups or movements?  How does this relate to protocol and control?  Does this influence how centralization and decentralization can be examined?
9.	Is the Internet a commodity?  Is the confrontation between users just a response between free access and paid access or is the issue more nuanced?  
10.	Is Galloway’s analysis based in geography?  Does his examination work when applied to all locations?  If not, is it valid?
11.	How does Galloway’s discussion f protocol affect our understanding of digital history?  Does working with control, and through protocols, change the nature of our work?  What are the possible pros and cons of this?
