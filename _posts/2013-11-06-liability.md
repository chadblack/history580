One thing I really appreciated from this week’s reading was the discussion of liability when considering the development of our digital history sites.  As a cultural historian, I am often confronted with this issue as it relates to what can and cannot be published within an article.  Cohen and Rosenzweig explain “working with the sources of the past, especially the twentieth-century past, puts you up against some of the thorniest copyright questions—and the most difficult issues to research.”  In my on experiences what falls into public domain and what does not is often confusing and full of wrong assumptions.  Therefore, this seems to be a really important aspect of developing a strong website.  Just as a historian is expected to follow appropriate citation and reference rules in their printed work, the same mindset needs to be attached to their digital content and analysis as well.  Because this is such a confusing and murky area, I wonder if it is not wise to begin incorporating more discussion of this issue within the digital humanities.  Therefore, just as a historian learns to utilize proper citation rules, should we also be learning copyright and public domain rules as well?  It seems that the nature o the field has changed and will only become more present online.  Therefore, this knowledge will be invaluable in developing smart and professional historians in the future.
