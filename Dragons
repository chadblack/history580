I've read hayden white before, and generally I like him. However, I found this article a little weird. Setting aside the fact that he doesn't appear to know much about the medieval chronicle besides what a few 19th century historians wrote about it, aren't there some records that are meant to evoke a localized and particular place and time rather than a broad narrative? To my mind, the chroncile is most like a modern diary. I don't keep a diary, but I do keep mementos that serve a similar function. I don't look at these mementoes as telling a narrative so much as evoking more acute memories that tend to blur together and lose their edge in the broad narrative of my life. Anyhow, looking forward to discussing this in class.

For what it's worth, the best entry ever occurs in the Anglo-Saxon chronicle. One year states: "Dragons were seen in the East." This was the first year of the Viking invasions. The vikings typically had dragons carved into the prows of their ships.
