This course is a strange bird for a History seminar. It is part theory and part practice. But, unlike normal research seminars, it involves a new set of skills outside of the traditional historian's normal purview. Learning new digital skills is a process of iterative failure. It requires an adventurous spirit, stubbornness, and a researcher's keen ability to figure out what the right questions to ask are. As such, the assignments for this course will draw on these values. Additionally, Digital History means many things, including research on digital objects, using digital tools to extend traditional methods, and new forms of historical presentation (data visualization, mapping, digital storytelling, archival narrative, etc.). Projects can be as varied as well, and individual or group.
